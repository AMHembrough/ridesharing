# Overview of the analysis

## The purpose of this analysis was to demonstrate to investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal.

# Results: 

## Most ride shares are less than 1 hr in duration, meaning more than 24 customers can utilize the same bike asset within a 24-hr period.  This is a great return on investment.

## Most ride shares, regardless of gender, are less than 1 hr in duration.

## During the work week, the greatest amount of ride sharing occurs during rush hour.  This suggests that the bikes will be used most often by working commuters, a seemingly low-risk customer type.

## During the work week, the greatest amount of ride sharing occurs during rush hour (6-9 am and 5-6pm), regardless of gender.  However, there are a greater number of male riders than there are female or "unknown" riders.

## The majority of bike share users are male subscribers, meaning returning clients!  This is a great return on investment.

# Summary

## The overall results of this analysis suggest that return on asset is high as users borrow bikes, on average, for less than one hour.  Further, the majority of bike shares occur during rush hour by male subscribers, meaning maintenance can be scheduled around known peak hours of use. 

## I would advice that continued analysis be conducted, specifically the following: 
-	Age of ride share client 
-	Ride sharing analysis during winter months
